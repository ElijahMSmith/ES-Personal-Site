-   Progressive blur on nav bar?
-   Hamburger for when navbar links are hidden on small site?
-   More fun animations! Ideas:
    -   Subtle motion in the background or activity (maybe a blur that follows you?)
    -   Specular highlight through intro text when you hover/approach it?
    -   Better link email hover highlight
